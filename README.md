# STATS-220
## STATS 220 repository for assignment 1 by Finn J.T de Lange

This repository is for my first assignment in STATS 200 - Data technologies.

* This was *necessary* for my assignment.
* avocados are **overrated**
* ðŸŽ·

There are a few goals in this assignment:

1. Pass
2. Get a better grade than *just* passing
3. Learn something

I kind of need to link more things, so here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/finn-de-lange-578637225?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app).

### Below is how every first lecture feels.
